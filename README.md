# The-Guessing-Game
Small project that I made for the class CISC 3120 Design and Implementation of Software Applications I. It asked that I create a "Guessing Game" using logic only. Subsequent exapansions included making a Command-Line interface, a Swing graphical user interface, and a JavaFX graphical user interface. 


Source codes could be found under The-Guessing-Game\The-Guessing-Game\GuessingGame\ directory

The core files of the game can be found under the core package, which is the logic strictly. 
The Command-Line interface package is called CLI, and within it the main() method is in MainCLI. 
The Swing graphical-user interface package is called Swing, and the main() method is within the MainSwing. 
The JavaFX graphical-user interface package is called JFX, and the main() method is within the MainFX.
